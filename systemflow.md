# System Flow Documentation

This document outlines the user journeys and system logic for the Repayment Stress Simulator. It maps our features to specific use cases to ensure a smooth demo and implementation.

---

## Flow 1: New User Onboarding & First Impression
**Goal:** Take a first-time user (e.g., a sari-sari store owner) from landing to their first "Aha!" moment with minimal friction.

### 1. Landing Page (The Hook)
- **User Action:** Arrives via mobile web or app.
- **System Display:** 
  - Visual headline: "Is your next loan safe for your business?"
  - Quick summary of the "Repayment Stress Simulator."
  - **CTA:** [Start Free Stress Test] or [Login/Sign Up].
- **Feature Integrated:** Value proposition highlighting the **True Cost Revealer**.

### 2. Registration/Login (The Trust Step)
- **User Action:** Enters basic credentials (or uses "Demo Mode/Guest" for the pitch).
- **System Requirement:** 
  - Collects minimal business profile: Store Name, Primary Sales Category (e.g., Grocery, Online Shop).
  - *Note: To maintain our "Laser-Focused Pitch" strategy, this step should be as fast as possible (e.g., One-tap Google or Phone login).*

### 3. Setup: Adaptive Cash Flow Profile (The Baseline)
**Goal:** Gather accurate data based on the user's specific income type to make the "Stress Test" relevant.

- **A. Category Selection:**
  - System asks: "How do you earn your money?"
    - **Option 1: I sell products** (Sari-sari, Online shop, Market vendor)
    - **Option 2: I provide a service/gig** (Grab/Lalamove rider, Barber, Freelancer)
    - **Option 3: I have a fixed salary** (Office worker, Kasambahay, Factory worker)

- **B. Branching Questions (Based on Category):**
  - **If Seller (Option 1):**
    - "Average daily sales?"
    - "How much do you spend on inventory/restocking?"
    - "Which days are your slowest?"
  - **If Service/Gig Worker (Option 2):**
    - "Average daily earnings/tips?"
    - "Daily costs to work (Gas, Load, Tool maintenance)?"
    - "Which days do you typically take off or have low demand?"
  - **If Fixed Salary (Option 3):**
    - "Monthly take-home pay?"
    - "Monthly fixed bills (Rent, Utilities, Internet)?"

- **C. Common Foundations (For All Users):**
  - **Personal Survival Floor:** "How much do you *need* to take home for your family's basic daily needs (Food, Medicine, School)?"
  - **Existing Debt:** "Total daily or weekly payments for other loans you are currently paying off?"
  - **Income Drop Sensitivity:** "How much can your income drop before you cannot safely repay?" (Feeds **Percentage Drop Testing**).

- **Feature Integrated:** **Contextual Micro-Lessons** (A tip appears: "Your 'Survival Floor' is your most important number. If a loan cuts into this, it puts your family at risk.")

### 4. Personal Dashboard (The Hub)
- **User Action:** Arrives at the main screen.
- **System Display:** 
  - Current "Cash Health" status (currently "Ready" since no loan is active).
  - Visual Feed: "Recent Loans Checked" (empty for new user).
  - **Primary CTA:** [Test a New Loan Offer].
- **Feature Integrated:** **Danger Zone Calendar** (Shows a preview of the current month with no risks marked yet).

## Flow 2: The Active Stress Test (Evaluating a Loan)
**Goal:** Transform raw loan numbers into a clear "Safe" or "Dangerous" decision for the user.

### 1. Loan Entry
- **User Action:** Clicks [Test a New Loan Offer] from the Dashboard.
- **Input Fields:** 
  - Loan Amount (e.g., ₱5,000)
  - Total Repayment (e.g., ₱7,500)
  - Due Date or Term (e.g., 30 days)

### 2. The "True Cost" Reveal
- **System Display:** An immediate "True Cost" card appears before the full simulation.
  - "This loan costs you **₱50 for every ₱100** you borrow."
  - "Your daily interest cost is **₱83/day**."
- **Feature Integrated:** **True Cost Revealer**.

### 3. The Stress Simulation (The "Aha!" Moment)
- **System Action:** Runs the loan numbers against the user's **Adaptive Profile** (Flow 1).
- **System Display:** A large, dynamic **Cash Health Gauge**.
  - **GREEN:** "Manageable. You maintain your survival floor and inventory needs."
  - **YELLOW:** "Thin Buffer. A few bad sales days could force you to use your food budget to pay."
  - **RED:** "High Risk. You will not have enough cash to pay."
- **Feature Integrated:** **Dynamic Repayment Stress Simulator**.

### 4. Deep-Dive: Breakpoints & Calendar
- **System Display:** Below the gauge, show the "Limits of Survival."
  - **Breakpoint:** "Your income can drop by **30%** before this loan becomes unsafe."
  - **Calendar View:** A monthly calendar with "Danger Zones" highlighted where payments fall on slow days or "Restock Days."
- **Feature Integrated:** **Breakpoint Analysis** and **Danger Zone Calendar**.

### 5. Resolution & Suggestions
- **User Action:** If the result is Yellow or Red, the user sees a "Safety Path" card.
- **System Display:**

## Flow 3: The "What-If" Crisis (Simulating Disruptions)
**Goal:** Prove the loan's resilience by modeling real-world unpredictable events that affect income.

### 1. Percentage Drop Selection
- **User Action:** While viewing a Stress Test result (Flow 2), the user clicks on the "Test Your Resilience" section.
- **System Display:** A set of interactive **Impact-Based Buttons**:
  - **[Moderate Drop - 30%]:** Models a 30% income drop for 7 days.
  - **[Major Disruption - 60%]:** Models a 60% income drop for 7 days.
  - **[Zero Income - 100%]:** Models a 100% income drop for 3 consecutive days.
  - **[Custom Slider]:** Allows user to manually drop income by any percentage (0% to 100%) to see the exact moment the gauge turns Red.
- **Feature Integrated:** **Breakpoint & Percentage Drop Testing**.

### 2. Dynamic Impact Animation
- **System Action:** Instantly recalculates the **Cash Health Gauge** and **Breakpoint Analysis** based on the selected percentage drop.
- **System Display:** The Gauge needle moves in real-time.
  - *Example:* A "Green" loan (Safe) may swing to "Red" (Danger) when the [3-Day Sickness] scenario is activated.

### 3. Crisis Explanation & Impact
- **System Display:** A blunt, factual summary of the financial gap:
  - "You are short by **₱1,200** on your due date."
  - "Warning: Your cash is fully depleted."

### 4. Resilience Recommendation
- **System Display:** Updates the **Safer Borrowing Suggestions** to account for the crisis.
  - "To survive a 3-day sickness with this loan, we recommend keeping a **₱2,500 cash buffer** on hand *before* you borrow."
  - "Alternatively, reducing the loan to **₱4,000** keeps you safe even if you get sick."
